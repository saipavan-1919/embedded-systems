How threads communicate:

	Threads execute one after the other.When one thread is terminated or in waiting mode then only next thread
	is executed,otherwise remaining threads stays in waiting mode.
	we need to create a global variable to make the threads communicate with each other.
	Threads share the code and data segment in the memory, so they can access the global vriable like for ex: "counter".
	when threads share the same global there are some problems in the output.
	data inconsistancy is the main problem with the shring of global varibles.
	when one thread is executing the remaining threads will be in waiting state.
