	Global variables can be accessed by everyone, so when we use global variables we get unexpected output.
	when we are using threads we mainly get data inconsistancy as a big problem. To overcome that we need to
	make threads safe.
	we can make the threads safe by using thread synchronization mechanisms.
	we can use signals to synchronise the threads and make the threads safe.

	we also have a mechanism which uses the semaphores. The semaphore is a special integer 's'.
	It can be accessed by only "sema_wait()" and "sema_post()" system calls.

	the programmer should write a code that synchronises the threads perfectly.
	The code must contain three sections, they are
	1)Entry section
	2)critical section
	3)exit section
